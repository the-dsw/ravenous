# The Ravenous project!

Welcome to the Ravenous project, a `Yelp-like clone`.

### Here's a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

- As a user, I should be able `to search` for restaurants
- As a user, I should be able `to view a list` of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
- As a user, I should be able `to sort` through restaurants using a filter
